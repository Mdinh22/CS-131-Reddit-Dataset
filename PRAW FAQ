What is PRAW?
PRAW is a API Wrapper that allows for calls to the Reddit API using simple Python-friendly syntax.

I use PyCharm. How do I use it?
In the terminal type:

pip install praw
pip install --upgrade praw

I use IDLE. How do I use it?
Requires command prompt.
1. Right-click on your Python folder, hold shift, right click, and click copy as path. In my case it was:  C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python.
2. Open command prompt.
3. Type: "cd" and then paste your path.
4. Type: "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py"
5. Type: "python get-pip.py."
6. In your python folder, copy as path the Scripts folder.
7. In command prompt, type "cd" and paste the new path.
8. Type "pip install praw"
9. Type "pip install --upgrade praw"

The main .py file should then be able to run.
